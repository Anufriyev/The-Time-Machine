Let's read one chapter from my book...

Comparison of events and processes (TIME)

Time is a procedure of comparison of processes(events). One process is standard. Another is playing role of measured one. Absolute  necessity for standard process is to have at list one parameter which is changes or have periodic events, cycles. Measured process, even it’s sound strange, may be even absence of process by itself. No changes, no events... we can speak  in this case about anti process. But, since we are living in material world, we will not do it, and we will call it process. Such processes (absence of process formally) more than ﻿enough in this world. Was process - movement, became a process of stillness. Anyway we can compare both with standard process.
For example , we can say as a result of comparison of process of rotation of the Earth around its own axis (standard process) with process of existing of the object(stone lays on the ground), what while Earth rotates 3 times around its own axes, object did not change it’s coordinates, orientation and still exists(stone still lays on the ground at the same position).
Let’s use another example. Moving object.
While Earth makes 12 rotations around its own axes, ship get to New-York from Saint Petersburg.
While Earth makes 6 rotations around the Sun, Afanasy Nikitin(﻿the first European who write a book about his travel to India)  made his journey ﻿beyond three seas.
 I am intentionally don’t use words Day and Year.
Day means what Earth made one full rotation around its axes.
Year means what Earth made one full rotation around the Sun.
So, from ancient time, man use this two expressions(Day,Year), and at some point start treat  this expressions  as measure of some mysterious object called time. But You already know that this is not true. This was the labels of two processes, rotation of the Earth around its own exes, and rotation of the Earth around the Sun. 
Time is the procedure, like we discuss its earlier. Not the object, not the field, not the mythological sub material substance. Just procedure or logical expression(information). 
When we use as a standard process something very routine(dawn for example), it is easy to transfer the comparison result. to numerical value.
You seen dawn 3 times - it is mean 3 days has pass.
Very convenient, no complicated calculations, no conversions.
But what about atomic clock for example? In this clock the standard process is the billion cycles per second process. So forced to convert the result of calculation of this cycles and use this very new result in another process which now became new standard process for observer.
Such a process is a process of changing images on the screen(virtual process). For example: was image of number 1 on the screen, now its image of number 2 on the screen. I am intentionally describe this procedure from such point of view, that we can see how the mechanical process connected
with virtual process. 
We can’t find any mystical substance(time) then we observe this process.
We get all that we need and we don’t need anything behind it.
Observer now compares process of changing images with measured process.
Idea is the same - comparing processes with each other. This is procedure...
If we use mechanical clock, observer compares the process of changing handles position with measured process. How it’s happened?
We just don’t count the cycles of the pendulum! We start observing more convenient standard process - the process of movement of the handle.
Dial help to connect the handle position with numerical value.
Many types of clock exists in the world. Chinese, from the ancient times,
use a candle as a clock. How we can use this incredible invention? 
For example, You want to read a book before going to sleep.
You are far from everybody, in the wild forest. You don’t want to use a flashlight(for emergency only). Use the candle then!
As a standard process in this case will be used the process of changing of candle length while its burning out. On the the candle we will put marks. When the fire get to this marks we will now: “15 minutes pass"(for example).
The fact of what standard process has ended by itself can be a waiting information. For example, the candle of certain length will burn completely
within 20 minutes. It burn out - enough of reading, time to sleep.
So , as You can see, if we want to have an idea how the process is going, we must compare this process with  another(standard one).
This is the only way to understand and analyze processes and events around 
and within. By observing them and compares them.
And we don’t have to find and catch mythological substance - Time.
We just use procedure , that someone, long time ago named - Time.
